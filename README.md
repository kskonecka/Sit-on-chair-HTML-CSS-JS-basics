SIT ON CHAIR is my first website, coded after 3 intensive weeks of learning HTML, CSS and Javascript principles.

It is a basic project created with tools I had just learned to use at the time.
It works on Chrome and Mozilla browsers and it's supposed to be viewed on big screens as it is not responsive.

The design is based on "warsztat1.jpg" which can be seen among the files above.

A few elements on the site have javascript functionalities (Vanilla JS):

1. when toggle-clicking the "about" menu, a sub-menu appears/dissapears;
2. in the main section, there is a basic gallery slider after clicking the "<" ">" icons;
3. in the small section with two photos and the "find all inputs" paragraph, the strings dissappear when mouse is over them;
4. there is also an order form where one can customize a chair. The form on the right displays the choices, the particular prices and the total price of a chair.
